## What is a Retro Image Prompt?  

A **retro image prompt** is a structured instruction that tells an AI model to generate visuals in a nostalgic or vintage style. A typical prompt includes:  
- **Subject** – the main focus (e.g., a person, couple, or product).  
- **Era or medium** – such as VHS, Polaroid, Film Noir, or 8-bit pixel art.  
- **Rendering cues** – like lighting, grain, scanlines, or halation.  
- **Mood** – nostalgic, dreamy, mysterious, glamorous, etc.  

Example:  
*“portrait of a couple, 1980s VHS still, soft CRT scanlines, warm halation, film grain.”*  

With **Retro Image Prompt**, you can either craft prompts manually or simply pick a preset retro style and let the system generate the perfect nostalgic look.
